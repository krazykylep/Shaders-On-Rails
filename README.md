This is a Rails project I came up with to improve my skills with ruby on rails.
I got a lot of inspiration from http://www.iquilezles.org/apps/shadertoy/
I had a rough (but fun) time trying to reimplement a shader editor.

__The site (so far) lets you:__
* Edit and view shaders at the same time using HTML5 canvas and WebGL.
* Log in with a social account like Google or Facebook.
* Track your published shaders if you are logged in.

__I am not done with this project yet. I have other ideas that I want to do:__
* Infinite scroll of saved shaders.
* Let you edit and delete shaders instead of only being able to create derivatives.
